## Overview
The generation of ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm layers is the most critical biological process during the gastrulation of embryo development. Such a differentiation process in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is an inherently nonlinear multi-stage dynamical process which contain multiple tipping points playing crucial roles in the cell-fate decision. However, the tipping points of the process are largely unknown, letting alone the understanding of the molecular regulation on these critical events. Here by designing a module-based dynamic network biomarker (M-DNB) model, we quantitatively pinpointed two tipping points of the differentiation of hESCs towards definitive endoderm, which leads to the identification of M-DNB factors (FOS, HSF1, MYCN, TP53 and MYC) of this process. 
The stage-specific and essential roles of M-DNB factors in the cell-fate decision were confirmed by the differentiation experiments. We demonstrate that before the tipping points, M-DNB factors are able to maintain the cell states and orchestrate cell fate determination during hESC (ES)-to-ME and ME-to-DE differentiation processes, which not only leads to better understanding of endodermal specification of hESCs but also reveals the power of the M-DNB model to identify critical transition points with their key factors in diverse biological processes including cell differentiation and transdifferentiation dynamics. <br />

## M-DNB analysis Guide
M-DNB model is designed based on matlab.
### Step1. Get network from PPI network
First, we should obtain the network from PPI network from STRING (https://cn.string-db.org/).
The PPI network of human can be downloaded from https://github.com/LinLi-0909/M-DNB-model/blob/main/9606.protein.links.v10.zip.
### Step2. Identify critical points and CI values of each gene module
**CI = Get_CI(data,time_Idx,feature,network);** <br />
**Input:**
**data** is time-series normailized scRNA-seq dataset(tpm,fpkm, or rpkm); <br /> 
genes*cells <br /> e.g. Chu-time dataset(download from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/acc=GSE75748&format=file&file=GSE75748%5Fsc%5Ftime%5Fcourse%5Fec%2Ecsv%2Egz, or https://github.com/LinLi-0909/M-DNB-model/blob/main/GSE75748_sc_time_course_ec.csv.gz).<br />

**time_Idx** is time points of samples;<br /> 
e.g Chu-time dataset contains 6 time points.The mat file can be downloaded from https://github.com/LinLi-0909/M-DNB-model/blob/main/timeIdx.mat. User can input time_Idx as below: <br />

**feature** is gene list in dataset.<br /> e.g.row name of Chu-time dataset. <br />
**network** is PPI network obtained from STRING. <br />
User can obtain network using the following code (matlab) and PPI network from STRING:
```
ex=importdata('9606.protein.links.v10.txt');
links=ex.textdata(2:end,1:2);
k=1;
network{1,1}=links{1,1};
network{1,2}{1,1}=links{1,2};
j=1;
for i=1:size(links,1)-1
    if strcmpi(links{i,1},links{i+1,1})
       network{k,2}{j+1,1}=links{i+1,2};
        j=j+1;
    else
        j=1;
        k=k+1;
       network{k,1}=links{i+1,1};
       network{k,2}{1,1}=links{i+1,2};
    end
end
network(:,3)=importdata('towhole.csv');
```
**Output:** <br />
CI: CI contains 4 columns for each gene module at each time point,which are  CI value, sd, PCC_in and PCC_out,respectively.<br />
And The CI of Chu-time dataset can be downloaded at https://github.com/LinLi-0909/M-DNB-model/blob/main/CI.mat <br />
### Step 3. Identify DNB genes at critical points
 **[topmCI,QI]=Get_Critical_Indicators(timeIdx,CI,m);**<br />
**Input:** <br />
 m is the top m-DNB genes with CI value in given critical point, e.g. m=50,100,150. users can also set the parameter as own request.<br />
 timeIdx and CI can be obtained from Step1 and Step2.<br />
 **Output:** <br />
 topmCI consists of genes with top m CI value at each time point.
 topmCI can be downloaded at https://github.com/LinLi-0909/M-DNB-model/blob/main/top50CI.mat<br />
 QI is the mean of top m CI value.
 
### Step4. Find M-DNB fatcors (TFs of DNB genes)
We can find M-DNB fatcors (TFs of DNB genes) based on IPA.
User can also investage the M-DNB factors (upstream regulator) based on publised datasets.
