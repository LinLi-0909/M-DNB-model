## Overview
The generation of ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm layers is the most critical biological process during the gastrulation of embryo development. Such a differentiation process in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is an inherently nonlinear multi-stage dynamical process which contain multiple tipping points playing crucial roles in the cell-fate decision. However, the tipping points of the process are largely unknown, letting alone the understanding of the molecular regulation on these critical events. Here by designing a module-based dynamic network biomarker (M-DNB) model, we quantitatively pinpointed two tipping points of the differentiation of hESCs towards definitive endoderm, which leads to the identification of M-DNB factors (FOS, HSF1, MYCN, TP53 and MYC) of this process. 
The stage-specific and essential roles of M-DNB factors in the cell-fate decision were confirmed by the differentiation experiments. We demonstrate that before the tipping points, M-DNB factors are able to maintain the cell states and orchestrate cell fate determination during hESC (ES)-to-ME and ME-to-DE differentiation processes, which not only leads to better understanding of endodermal specification of hESCs but also reveals the power of the M-DNB model to identify critical transition points with their key factors in diverse biological processes including cell differentiation and transdifferentiation dynamics.
